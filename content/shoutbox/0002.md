Also, dont worry the posts here are not misaligned or something, I just wanted it to have the feel of a conversation, bassically this is a place where I talk with myself. Kinda weird if you thing about it but oh well. As for the old posts I've put them on the old site's private github repo, only one that still remains is the [neon white](/neon-white) one because I felt like it was needed for the neon white video.
