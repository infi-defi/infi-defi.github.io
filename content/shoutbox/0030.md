I want to make more things this year.  
Both code and content wise.  
First I just need to finish with exams.  
  
I wanna re make this site as I've probs said in the past.  
I wanna make a fast paced platformer game.  
Maybe create a video of some sort..?  
  
Generally I wanna improve my programming and creative skills.
  
But first I need to finish with exam season...
