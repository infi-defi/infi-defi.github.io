    <div class="about-me">
      <p>Hey, I’m iNFdV (stylized exactly like that), a first-year computer science undergrad with a severe case of shiny object syndrome and a habit of diving way too deep into random topics at 2AM. If one of them holds my attention long enough, it might turn into a video on my YouTube channel (emphasis on might - expect a finished project sometime before the end of the decade).</p>
      <p>This is my personal website. I used to have a blog here, but like most ambitious things I start, it got neglected and left to gather digital dust - so now it’s more of a shoutbox / online business card / general internet doohickey. I wanted to learn how to make a Hugo theme anyway, so here we are. If you wanna chat, share cool stuff, or yell at me to finally finish something, I mostly hang out on Discord. Email’s also an option if you're feeling fancy.</p>
